Sample input
competitions = [
  ["HTML", "C#"],
  ["C#", "Python"],
  ["Python", "HTML"]
]

results = [0, 0, 1]

Sample output
"Python"


Steps before code:
	1. Create a hashmap for all the teams
	2. Traverse the results list
	3. If the current element is 0, look for the awayTeam that won in the hashmap
	   and add 3 to the value. If the element is 1, then add 3 to the homeTeam in
	   the hashmap.
	4. Output the team with most points in the hashmap
