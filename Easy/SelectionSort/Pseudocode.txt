Sample input
	array = [8, 5, 2, 9, 5, 6, 3]
	
Sample output
	[2, 3, 5, 5, 6, 8, 9]
	
	
	
	
Steps before code:
	1. Run a nested for loop
	2. at each iteration in the inner loop, find the smallest number starting from the index of the outer loop + 1
	3. Compare that number with the value at the index of the outer loop, if the number is greater than the smallest number, swap them
	4. output the newly sorted array
