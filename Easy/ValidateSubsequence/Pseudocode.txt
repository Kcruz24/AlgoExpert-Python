Sample input:
   array = [5, 1, 22, 25, 6, -1, 8, 10]
   sequence = [1, 6, -1, 10]


Sample output:
   true

[5, 1, 22, 25, 6, -1, 8, 10]
                         p

[1, 6, -1, 10]
           p

O(N) time | O(1) space - SOLUTION:
   1. Initalize a pointer to keep track of the position
      in the sequence array.
   2. run a loop through the array
   3. at each iteration, check if the current number is equal
      to the current number based on the pointer in the sequence
      array, if its equal, increase the pointer by 1
   4. if the loop ends and the length of the sequence is not equal
      to the value of the pointer, return false, otherwise, 
      return true
