Sample input
	redShirtSpeeds = [5, 5, 3, 9, 2]
	blueShirtSpeeds = [3, 6, 7, 2, 1]
	fastest = true
	
Sample output
	32
	

Steps before code:
	1. Declare a variable to store the total speed
	2. Start a loop that will continue until one of the arrays is empty
	3. at each iteration pair the maximum rider with red shirt with the minimum rider with blue shirt if the fastest param 
	   is true, otherwise get the maximum rider with blue shirt
	4. get the max value out of those two riders and add it to the total speed variable
	5. pop the chosen riders
	6. at the end of the loop, output the total speed
