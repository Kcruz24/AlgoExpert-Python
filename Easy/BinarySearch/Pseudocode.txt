array = [0, 1, 21, 33, 45, 45, 61, 71, 72, 73]
target = 33

output:
3

Steps before code:
    1. initialize a "start" variable with 0
    2. initialize an "end" variable with the last index of the array
    3. initialize a "mid" variable that will be the sum of start and end variables
       divided by two.
    4. Run a while loop that will end when the "start" variable is less than the
       "end" variable
    5. On each iteration, check if the "mid" variable value is equal to the
       target. If equal, return the target index.
    6. If the target value is greater than the "mid" variable value,
       then update the "mid" variable to be the new "start" variable.
    7. If the target value is less than the "mid" variable value,
       then update the "mid" variable to be the new "end" variable.

    If the loop ends without finding the target value, return -1.

Steps after code:
    1. initialize a "start" variable with 0
    2. initialize an "end" variable with the last index of the array
    3. Run a while loop that will end when the "start" variable is less than the
       "end" variable
    4. On each iteration:
       1. set the "mid" variable to be the sum of the start and
          end variables divided by two.
       2. Check if the "mid" variable value is equal to the target.
          If equal, return the target index.
       3. If the target value is greater than the "mid" variable value,
          then update the "mid" variable to be the new "start" variable.
       4. If the target value is less than the "mid" variable value,
          then update the "mid" variable to be the new "end" variable.

    If the loop ends without finding the target value, return -1.
