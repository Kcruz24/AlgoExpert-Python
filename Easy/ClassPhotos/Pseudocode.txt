Sample input
	redShirtHeights = [5, 8, 1, 3, 4]
	blueShirtHeights = [6, 9, 2, 4, 5]
	
Sample output
	true
	

	
Steps before code:
	1. Loop through the length of one of the arrays
	2. at each iteration compare the height of the blue shirt position with the height of the corresponding red shirt position
	3. If all of the heights in the back row are taller, return true, otherwise return false
	

Steps after code:
	1. Sort both input arrays.
	2. Check what student is the tallest of both rows
	3. Set the row with the tallest student as the back row
	4. Run a loop through the lenght of one of the arrays.
	5. At each iteration, compare every student in the back row with those on the front row to verify that they are taller.
	6. If the loop run successfuly, return true, otherwise return false.
