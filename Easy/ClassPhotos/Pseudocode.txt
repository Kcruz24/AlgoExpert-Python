Sample input
	redShirtHeights = [5, 8, 1, 3, 4]
	blueShirtHeights = [6, 9, 2, 4, 5]
	
Sample output
	true
	

	
Steps before code:
	1. Loop through the length of one of the arrays
	2. at each iteration compare the height of the blue shirt position with the height of the corresponding red shirt position
	3. If all of the heights in the back row are taller, return true, otherwise return false
	

Steps after code:
	1. Sort both arrays in descending order
	2. Determine what shirt color is going to be in the first row
	3. loop through the length of one of the arrays
	4. at each iteration check who's in the first row
	5. then return false if the shirt on the first row is taller or equal to the shirt on the back row
	6. if the loop ends without any problems, return True
