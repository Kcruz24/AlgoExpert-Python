Sample input
	array = [141, 1, 17, -7, -17, -27, 18, 541, 8, 7, 7]
	
Sample output
	[18, 141, 541]
	

	
I would create an array to store the largest numbers, then 
I would start asigning the first number of the array as the largest number,
then I would add the second and check if its greater than the number already in my helper array, if its greater I would swap them, if not then the new number would stay in the same place. Keep repeating tha process until the loop ends going through the array.
	
	

Steps before code:
	1. Create an array to store the largest numbers
	2. Run a loop through the array
	3. Add the first number in the array as the largest number in the new array.
	4. From the second number onwards, add them to the helper array
	5. Compare the array number with the numbers inside the helper array
	6. If the new number is greater than any of the numbers inside the helper array, swap them to the corresponding places.
	7. When the loop ends, the helper array should have the three largest numbers so I would output that result.
	

Steps after code:
	1. Create an array to store the three largest numbers
	2. Sort the array
	3. run a loop through the input array
	4. at each iteration check if the current num in the input array is greater than the first number in the helper array and if is not in the helper array
	5. if that statement is true, then pop the first number in the helper array and insert at that position the current number in the input array, then sort the helper array
	6. When the loop ends, return the helper array
