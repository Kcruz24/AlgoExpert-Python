O(N + M) time SOlUTION:
	1. Create a dictionary to keep track of the frequencies
	   in the "characters" array.
	2. Run a loop through the "document" array
	3. at each iteration, I will look the current letter of
	   the document in the dictionary, if the frequency is greater
	   than 0, then substract 1 from the value, otherwise, return
	   false.
	4. if the loop runs successfuly, return true
