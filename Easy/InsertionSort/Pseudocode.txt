sample input:
array = [8, 5, 2, 9, 5, 6, 3]

sample output:
[2, 3, 5, 5, 6, 8, 9]



steps before code:
    1. Initialize a "sorted_idx" variable as the first element in
       the input array.
    2. Initialize an "unsorted_idx" variable as the "sorted_idx" + 1.
    3. start a for loop for the array
    4. compare the "sorted_idx" and "unsorted_idx" variables, if the
       "unsorted_idx" is less than the "sorted_idx" variable, swap them.
    5. if the "sorted_idx" part is greater than 1 elem, keep comparing and
       swapping if necessary.
    6. Loop again until the array is sorted.


steps after solution code:
    1. start a for loop from the second element in the input array.
    2. Initialize an "unsorted_value" variable and set it equal the for loop
       variable.
    3. Run a while loop while "unsorted_value" is greater than 0 and
       array[unsorted_value] is less than array[unsorted_value - 1]
    4. On each while loop iteration:
       1. swap the "unsorted_value" with the "unsorted_value" - 1
       2. decrease the "unsorted_value" variable by 1

    Finally, when the for loop ends, return the sorted array.
