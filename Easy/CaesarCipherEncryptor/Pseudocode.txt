Sample input
string = "xyz"
key = 2

Steps before code:
	1. Create an alphabet variable that will contain all the alphabet letters.
	2. Get the index of each letter in the given string
	3. Sum those indexes with the value of key.
	4. Using the modulo operator I will retrieve the correct later based on the number of shifts made by the key.
	5. Output the encrypted message.
