Sample input
    array = [5, 2, [7, -1], 3, [6, [-13, 8], 4]]

Sample output
    12

5 + 2 + 2(7 - 1) + 3 + 2(6 + 3(-13 + 8) + 4)
7 + 12 + 3 + 2(6 - 15 + 4)
7 + 12 + 3 - 10
12

[8, [3, 4]]

Steps before code:
    1. Initialize a variable to track the level of depth and another to store
       the sum.
    2. Go through the given array and sum the values, when a "special" array
       is detected, call the function again
    3. When going back from the call stack, multiply the level of depth with
       the current sum
    4. return the product sum


Steps after code:
    1. Create a second parameter to track the level of depths
    2. Initialize a sum varialbe to store the product sum
    3. Go through each element in the given array
    4. If the element is an integer, add it to the sum variable, otherwise
       call the function, pass in the element, increase by one the level
       of depth and then add it to the sum variable
    5. When the loop ends, return the current sum times the level of depth.
