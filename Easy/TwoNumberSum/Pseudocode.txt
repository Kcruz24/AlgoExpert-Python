(O(Nlog(N) SOLUTION):
   1. initialize two pointers, one at the beginning and one at the end
   2. sum up the pointer's elements
   3. check if the result is equal to the targetSum
   4. if equal, return the value of both pointers.
   5. If the sum of the two pointer's elements is less than the targetSum,
      increase the start pointer and repeat process 2 - 4.
   6. If the sum of the two pointer's elements is greater than the targetSum,
      decrease the end pointer and repeat process 2 - 4.


(O(N) SOLUTION):
   1. create a set called "distinct_nums"
   2. for each num in the array, calculate the potential_match by substracting the current num in the array from the targetSum (targetSum - num)
   3. check if the current num is not in distinct_nums, if is not, the add the potential_match to distinct_nums, otherwise, return as a list the current num and the potential_match.
   4. if the loop ends and no pair was found, return an empty list.
