Pseudocode:

1. initialize two pointers, one at the beginning and one at the end
2. sum up the pointer's elements
3. check if the result is equal to the targetSum
4. if equal, return the value of both pointers.
5. If the sum of the two pointer's elements is less than the targetSum,
   increase the start pointer and repeat process 2 - 4.
6. If the sum of the two pointer's elements is greater than the targetSum,
   decrease the end pointer and repeat process 2 - 4.
