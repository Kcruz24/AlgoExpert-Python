Sample input
	string = "AAAAAAAAAAAAABBCCCCDD"
	
Sample output
	"9A4A2B4C2D"
	
	
Steps before code:
	1. declare a variable that will store the result
	2. declare a counter variable to count the current length
	2. loop through the given string
	3. count the duplicate chars
	4. if the count is greater than 9, encode the current char and add it to the encode variable
	5. when the loop is done, return the encoded variable
