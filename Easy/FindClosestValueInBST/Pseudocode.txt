Steps after code (Recursive approach):
	1. initialize a closest variable with float('inf')
	2. set a base case that will stop when the current node hits a leaf node.
	3. then compare the absolute value of the current node minus the target with the absolute value of the closest node value minus the target.
	4. If the current node minus the target is less than the closest node minus the target then update the closest node value.
	5. when the function hits the base case, return the closest node
	6. at the end of the function, return the closest as well
