Sample input
	array = [8, 5, 2, 9, 5, 6, 3]
	
Sample output
	[2, 3, 5, 5, 6, 8, 9]
	
	

	
Steps before code:
	1. run a nested for loop
	2. at each iteration inside the inner loop, check if the value at the index of the outer loop is greater than the value at the index of the inner loop.
	3. if is greater, swap them.
	4. output the newly sorted input array
