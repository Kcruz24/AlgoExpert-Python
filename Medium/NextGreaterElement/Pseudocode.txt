Steps:
   1. Create two pointers, one for the current element,
      and the other to search for the next greater element.
   2. a nested loop will be implemented
   3. the second loop will run until the second
      pointer index its equal to the index of the first
      pointer.
   4. to avoid the out of bounds exception, I will be
      updating the second pointer index with the modulo
      operator by the length of the array.
   5. Each time we find the next greater element, I'll add it
      to a helper array, and if its not found, then I'll add a -1 to it.
