Steps:
	1. Create a copy of the matrix with all false values to
	   keep track of the visited nodes.
	2. Create an array to keep track of all the river sizes.
	3. Loop through the matrix starting from the first position.
	4. Initialize a running_sum variable to keep track of the current
	   river size.
	5. If I find a one, check if the node has already been visited,
	   if not, then I'll do a DFS to see how bigh the river is and
	   if the node has been visited I'll just keep looping through
	   the matrix.
	6. I'll then add one to the running sum for each connected one
	   including the current river.
	7. After the DFS has finished, I'll add the running sum to the 
	   helper array and then I'll reset the value of the running sum
	   to 0.
	8. Return the river_sizes array.
