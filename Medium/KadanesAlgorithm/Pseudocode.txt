Sample input:
	array = [3, 5, -9, 1, 3, -2, 3, 4, 7, 2, -9, 6, 3, 1, -5, 4]

Sample output:
	19 // [1, 3, -2, 3, 4, 7, 2, -9, 6, 3, 1]


Steps:
   1. create two variables, one to get all the greatest 
      sums, and another to keep track of the max 
      subarray sum.
   2. initialize the two variables with the first value of the input
      array.
   3. start a loop from the second position in the array
   4. at each iteration, we use this formula max(max_ending_here + num, num) for
      the variable that will get all the greatest sums (called max_ending_here).
      and then use this formula max(max_sub_array_sum, max_ending_here) for the 
      variable that will give us the max subarray sum.
   5. When the loop ends, return the max_sub_array_sum variable.
