Sample input:
	array = [3, 5, -9, 1, 3, -2, 3, 4, 7, 2, -9, 6, 3, 1, -5, 4]

Sample output:
	19 // [1, 3, -2, 3, 4, 7, 2, -9, 6, 3, 1]


Steps before:
	1. create a variable to keep track of the max sum and another to keep
	   track of the running sum.
	2. loop through the array and add each value to the running sum
	3. if the current value is less than 0 and the running sum is less than
	   or equal to 0, then set the running sum equal to 0
	4. else if the current value is less than 0, then create a variable called
	   lastSumBeforeNegative and set it to the sum of the running sum plus the
	   absolute value of the current value
	5. check if the lastSumBeforeNegative is greater than the max sum, if it 
	   is, then set the max sum equal to the lastSumBeforeNegative
	6. After the loop is finished, check if the latest value in the running 
	   sum is greater than the max sum, if it is, then set the max sum 
	   equal to the running sum
	7. return the max sum
