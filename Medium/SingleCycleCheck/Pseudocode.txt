Single Cycle Check

My Solution
Steps:
    1. Establish our initial idx as the next jump in the given array
    2. Initialized an empty visited idx array
    3. Loop through the array until we reach the end of the array
    4. If the current idx is not in the visited idx array,
       add it to the visited idx array and update the current idx to
       the next jump in the array
    5. If the current idx is in the visited idx array, return false
    6. If the current idx is NOT in the visited idx array and length of the
       visited idx array is equal to the length minus one of the input array
       return true
    7. if the loop ends, return False
