Single Cycle Check

Steps:
	1. Initialize an array with same size as the input array filled
	   with false values.
	2. Loop through the array while the helper array has at least one false
	   value or if the traversing pointer comes accross an already visited node.
	3. To cycle through the array, I will sum the current node value with its 
	   index and then use the modulo operator to wrap around the array
	5. If the helper array has all true values, then return true, if not, return
	   false
