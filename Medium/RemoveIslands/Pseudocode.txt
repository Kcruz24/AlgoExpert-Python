Steps:
   1. Start a loop to go through the matrix
   2. Whenever we find a 1, we check if its on the border.
   3. I it is on the border, then we check for its neighbors and add
      1 to them aswell as the first 1 that we found.
   4. if its not on the border, we simply do nothing.
   5. After all the 1's that are not islands have been identified.
   6. We then loop through the matrix again and this time around
      we substract 1 to any number greater than 0.
   7. return the array.
